# materialize_portfolio

## H2 This portfolio leverages the Materialize framework (https://materializecss.com/) for visual components including:

- Cards (https://materializecss.com/cards.html)
- Buttons (https://materializecss.com/buttons.html)
- Navbar (https://materializecss.com/navbar.html)
- Footer (https://materializecss.com/footer.html)

## H2 For DOM manipulation and animation applications, the jQuery library was used (https://jquery.com/)

The idea for the portfolio is to create a more "modern" feel for websites, including visual animations for the three main sections that compose the portfolio ("About Me", "Portfolio", and "Contact" form).  

Custom Javascript and CSS were added to achieve these effects, including gauging where the user currently is scrolled to (to trigger fading/flying in animations).  

Similarly in the Portfolio section, JS and CSS were used to create a "highlighting" effect with a CSS Transform animation for the portfolio assignment that the user is currently hovering over.  "onMouseEnter" and "onMouseLeave" JS methods were crucial for achieving this effect.
